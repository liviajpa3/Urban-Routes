# Urban Routes - Routes and Vehicle Sharing Application  

Project developed as part of the **TripleTen Bootcamp**.  

---

## Description  
I participated in the development and quality assurance of the **Urban Routes** application, a route and vehicle-sharing platform that calculates travel time and costs for different modes of transportation (car, taxi, bicycle, scooter, etc.).  

The project was divided into three sprints, where I worked through the **entire QA cycle**, including test design, regression testing, checklist creation, functionality validation, and bug reporting in **Jira**.
